# Tag Inspector - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** NOV 2025

## Data Collection

Tag Inspector does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. The extension operates entirely locally within your browser.

## How It Works

- Tag Inspector analyzes HTML tags on web pages you visit
- All analysis happens locally in Chrome DevTools
- No data is sent to external servers
- No data is stored on remote servers
- No tracking or analytics are performed

## User-Initiated Actions

- Users can optionally export tag data as JSON or CSV files to their local computer
- These exports are saved locally and are not transmitted anywhere
- The extension does not have access to these exported files

## Permissions

The extension requires:
- **tabs permission**: To identify the active tab and communicate with the content script
- **Host permissions (http://*/*, https://*/*)**: To inject a content script that analyzes tags on web pages

These permissions are used solely for tag analysis and are not used to collect or transmit any user data.

## What We Don't Do

- We do not collect personally identifiable information
- We do not track your browsing history
- We do not monitor your activity
- We do not send any data to external servers
- We do not use third-party analytics or tracking services
- We do not sell or share any data (because we don't collect any)

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.

**Summary:** Tag Inspector is a privacy-first extension. All tag analysis happens locally in your browser. We don't collect, store, or transmit any data. Your privacy is our priority.
